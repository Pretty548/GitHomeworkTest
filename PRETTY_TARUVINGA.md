Hi my name is Pretty and my favourite sport is dancing and i like the fact that i will be listening to my favourite music whilst dancing. 

My favourite food is Fish and Chips. Its easier to make and its rich in nutrients. You can get it on a food takeout as well

You might want to listen to my favourite song https://youtu.be/zQxN_pwYhNY 

The most intresting about myself is i enjoy doing a lot of things. I am a chef, au pair, social media influencer, a mom and i am a student. Everything works well because i am also an introvert so i manage my time well aand it goes hand in hand
